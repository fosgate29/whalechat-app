# Referral Program

Earn `WHALE` tokens by referring crypto whales or proving your own crypto wealth!

## How it woks

1. If you refer WhaleChat app to your crypto-whale friend and he/she submits asset proofs, both you and your friend will `WHALE` when the referral program ends
2. If you refer WhaleChat to your friend who in turns refer a crypto-whale, everybody in the chain will get some `WHALE`!
3. The Referral Program ends the Goal for each asset has been reached.

## Scheme Details

### Reward Formula

The `WHALE` that you obtain from an asset proof is basically calculated by:

`asset_proved * exchange_rate * coefficent`

- `asset_proved` is the amount of cryptocurrency being proved. For example, if someone submitted asset proof of 50 BTC, this would be `50`
- `exchange_rate` is the "Full Reward Rate" in the table below. For example, if someone submitted asset proof of 50 BTC, this would be `50 * 350 = 17500`
- `coefficent` is where you are at in the "chain of referral":
  - For example, if your own referral code is a "genesis" / "level 0" referral code, and you submits an asset proof yourself, then your `coefficient` is `1`
  - If your own referral code is "level 0", and you refer to a friend (so your friend is "level 1"), and your friend submits an asset proof, then your `coefficient` is `0.5` and your friend's `coefficient` is also `0.5`
  - If your own referral code is "level 1" (i.e. your referrer is a "level 0"), and you submit an asset proof yourself, then your `coefficient` is `0.5`
  - If your own referral code is "level 1", and you refer to a friend (so your friend is "level 2"), and your friend submits an asset proof, then your `coefficient` is `0.25` and your friend's `coefficient` is also `0.25`
  - ... and so on

### Rates

## FAQ

**1. What if the asset Goal is never reached? Will I ever get my WHALE tokens?**

If after enough time (about a year or so) the target still couldn't be reached, the referral program could end and the `WHALE` reward will be given pro-rata to the target.
